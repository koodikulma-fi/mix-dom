## MixDOM

MixDOM is a state based DOM rendering library for JavaScript/TypeScript. It provides a flexible framework for building user interfaces all the way up to complex application with several laterally interrelated parts - using contexts with their data and signals from "data-signals". Get the most out of MixDOM by using a JSX compiler and TypeScript.
