## Note

This repo is for developing v4. Work in progress.

Current state:
- Refactored to use new "data-signals" base. Not tested at all. Not likely to work 100% correctly currently.
- Note. Tried changing Routines to static classes from direct export functions but fattened the MixDOM.module.js size from 61.4KB to 64.0KB. Changed back.

## MixDOM

MixDOM is a state based DOM rendering library for JavaScript/TypeScript. It provides a flexible framework for building user interfaces all the way up to complex application with several laterally interrelated parts - using contexts with their data and signals from "data-signals". Get the most out of MixDOM by using a JSX compiler and TypeScript.
